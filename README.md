AI Math Tool is an intelligent system built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to solve handwritten mathematical expressions. Users input equations like 5 + 7 through image input, and the model automatically recognizes the digits and operators to compute the result. We implemented basic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Despite an average accuracy of around 60%, the model was able to provide correct results in many cases, showcasing the potential of deep learning for image-based equation solving.
